      <description>In this blog post we will see introduction to machine learning using python. We will train model on two different datasets using two different type of machine learning algorithm one for classifier and other for regression.The learning algorithm finds the pattern in the training data which maps the input data features to target variable and it outputs an machine learning model that captures these patterns. Also we will learn about scikit-learn library in detail (coming soon).</description>

      <description>This post is an effort of showing an approach of Machine learning in R using tidyverse and tidymodels. We will go through step by step from data import to final model evaluation process in machine learning. We will not just focus on coding part but also the statistical aspect should be taken into account behind the modelling process. In this tutorial we are using titanic dataset from Kaggle competition.</description>
