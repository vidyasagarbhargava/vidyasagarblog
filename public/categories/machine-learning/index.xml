      <description>In this blog post we will see introduction to machine learning using python. We will code two different type of machinelearning pipe line one for classifier and other for regression on toy datasets. These both pipelines can be used as a template for machine learning problem. A part from that we will learn about scikit-learn library. In the coming post we will use pipeline on more complex dataset from kaggle.</description>

      <description>This post is an effort of showing a new approach of modelling in R using tidyverse and tidymodels.We will go through step by step from data import to final model evaluation process in machine learning. We will not just focus on coding part but also the statistical aspect should be taken into account behind the modelling process. In this tutorial we are using titanic dataset from Kaggle competition.</description>
