      <description>Table of Contents Role of underscore
 Role of Asterisk
 Decorators    1. Role of underscore(_) Underscore (_) is a unique character in python. It has special meaning in different situations.
Lets see first situation where it automatically stores the value of last expression and can be assign value to another variable. Check below example.
5+4 ## 9 _ ## 9 _ + 9 ## 18 a = _ a ## 18 Secondly you can use it as variable in loop.</description>

      <description>Pandas is a package which is built on top of Numpy and provides efficient implementation of DataFrame. These dataframes are multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels and often with heterogenous types.In this post we will focus on Series, DataFrame and related structure effectively.
Installing and Using Pandas Once pandas is installed you can import and check the version.
import pandas as pd pd.__version__ ## &amp;#39;0.24.2&amp;#39;  Pandas Objects There are three fundamental pandas objects or structures : the Series, DataFrame and Index.</description>

      <description>Numpy Numpy (Short for Numerical Python) provides an efficient interface to Store and operate on arrays of number. Its somewhat looks like python’s builtin list type but much more efficient as the arrays grows in size.
import numpy as np np.__version__ ## &amp;#39;1.8.0rc1&amp;#39;  How numpy improves the performances as compare to base python operartions on arrays of data?
 Python is dynamic typing language unlike C and JAVA which are statically type language that requires variable to be declare explicitly.</description>

      <description>Python was released with philosophy which emphasizes simplicity, code readibility and efficiency.Being an Object Oriented Programming language python groups data and code into objects that can interact with and modify one another. Data Science is small portion with in diverse python ecosystem. Python has deep learning and machine learning libraries which includes scikit-learn, Keras and tensorflow.
Help and Documentation in python: Every python object contains the reference to a string, known as doc string, which contain a concise summary of the object and how to use it.</description>

      <description>Python is an “Object Oriented Programming language” or OOP for short. It is a programming paradigm which focuses on reusable pattern of code, in contrast to procedural programming, which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions. When working on complex programs, object oriented programming let you reuse code and write code that is more readable, which in turn makes it more maintainable.

      <description>Python is most popular programming language among data scientists across the world and like high level languages, python is easy to read, take less time to write and is portable. So in this post we will learn about basics of python which includes variables, numbers conditionals, functions, list, dictionary, set, expression etc…
Table of Contents:- Variable, Numbers and Strings
 Conditionals
 Functions
 List, dictionary, Set, Expression    1.</description>

      <description>In this post we will see demo of two machine learning problems using python. We will train model on two different datasets using two different type of machine learning algorithm one for classifier and other for regression.The learning algorithm finds the pattern in the training data which maps the input data features to target variable and it outputs an machine learning model that captures these patterns. Also we will learn about scikit-learn library in detail (coming soon).</description>
