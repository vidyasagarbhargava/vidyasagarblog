      <description>There are three distinct types of problems in the field machine learning.
Unsupervised Learning :- So in this type we only have inputs and we try to model the distribution in order to better understand the underlying structure.
For example :-   We have census data and try to split segment people into different unknown categories.  Supervised Learning :- Here we create a model that can predict an output from an input.</description>

      <description>In this post we will see demo of two machine learning problems using python. We will train model on two different datasets using two different type of machine learning algorithm one for classifier and other for regression.The learning algorithm finds the pattern in the training data which maps the input data features to target variable and it outputs an machine learning model that captures these patterns. Also we will learn about scikit-learn library in detail (coming soon).</description>
