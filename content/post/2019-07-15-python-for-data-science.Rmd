#### Help and Documentation in python:  

Every python object contains the reference to a string, known as *doc string*, which contain a concise summary of the object and  how to use it. Python has built-in `help()` function that can access this information and prints the result.  

For example to see the documentation of built-in function `len()` :-  
 

```{python}
help(len)
```


> 👉 In Ipython the other option is to use `?` character as a shorthand for accessing the documentation and other relevant information.  


Note that this `help()` function or `?` shorthand also works for functions and other objects which we create by ourself.    

Lets define a simple function with a docstring.  

```{python}
def cube(a):
    """Return the cube of a. """
    return a ** 3
    
```


Now we will use `help()` function to find the docstring.  

```{python}
help(cube)
```


> 👉This quick access to documentation via docstrings is one reason you should get in the habit of always adding such inline documentation to the code you write!


**Important Points regarding help and documentation.**    

- To read the source code of the object use `??` shorthand in Ipython.      
- To see a list of all available attributes of an object type the name of object followed by a period `.` character and the TAB key.`L.<TAB>`
- To list private/internal attributes or methods by explicitly typing the underscrore. `L._<TAB>`

#### Numpy  

Numpy (Short for Numerical Python) provides an efficient interface to Store and operate on arrays of number.Its somewhat looks like python's builtin `list` type but much more efficient as the arrays grows in size.  


```{python} 
import numpy as np
np.__version__
```


How numpy improves the performances as compare to base python operartions on arrays of data?  


Python is dynamic typing language unlike C and JAVA, statically type language which requires variable to be declare explicitly. 



```
/* C code */
int result = 0;
for(int i=0; i<100; i++){
    result += i;
}
```

While in python the equivalent operation  could be written this way :  

```{python}
result = 0
for i in range(100):
    result +=i
```




If you notice the difference data type of each variables are explicitly declared in C while in python types are dynamically inferred. So we can assign any type of data to any variable in python.  


```{python}
#python code
x = 4
x = "four"
```

Same thing in C would lead to compilation error.

```
/* C code */
int x = 4;
x = "four" //fails

```

This type of flexibility makes python convenient and easy to use but this type-flexibility also points to the fact that python variables are more than just their value. They also contains the extra information about the type of value.  



> 👉  The standard python implementation was written in C.


When we define an integer in python  for example `x = 100` is not just a "raw" integer. It is actually a pointer to a compound C structure which contains several values.   If we see the source code of python 3.4 or above we find that integer in python actually contains 4 pieces.  

-  `ob_refcnt` a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation  
-  `ob_type`  which encodes the type of the variable  
-  `ob_size`  which specifies the size of the following data members  
-  `ob_digit` which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent.  



....More explanation sooon....



# Fixed type arrays in python  

The built in array module helps in creating dense arrays of a uniform type.  

```{python}
import array
L = list(range(10))
A = array.array('i',L)
A
```
Here `'i' `is a type code indicating the contents are integers.


Python's `array` object provides efficient storage of array-based data, NumPy adds to this efficient operations on that data.

```{python}
import numpy as np
np.array([1,2,3,5,6])
```
 

> 👉  NumPy is constrained to arrays that all contain the same type. If types do not match, NumPy will upcast if possible.  


```{python}
np.array([3.14, 1, 2.0,3 ,5])
```

Explicity set the data type using keyword `dtype`.  


```{python}
np.array([1,2,3,4], dtype='float32')
```


numpy array can be multi-dimensional unlike python lists.  

```{python}
# nested lists result in multi-dimensional arrays
np.array([range(i, i + 3) for i in [2, 4, 6]])
```


Creating Arrays from scratch using routines built into NumPy. 


```{python}
# Create a length-10 integer array filled with zeros
np.zeros(10, dtype=int)

# Create a 3x5 floating-point array filled with ones
np.ones((3,5), dtype=float)

# Create a 3x5 array filled with 3.14
np.full((3,5),3.14)

# Create an array filled with a linear sequence
# Starting at 0, ending at 20, stepping by 2
np.arange(0, 20, 2)

# Create an array of five values evenly spaced between 0 and 1
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)

# Create a 3x3 array of uniformly distributed
# random values between 0 and 1
np.random.random((3, 3))
# Create a 3x3 array of normally distributed random values
# with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
np.random.normal(0, 1, (3, 3))

# Create a 3x3 array of random integers in the interval [0, 10)
np.random.randint(0, 10, (3, 3))
# Create a 3x3 identity matrix
np.eye(3)

# Create an uninitialized array of three integers
# The values will be whatever happens to already exist at that memory location
np.empty(3)

```


Now we will discuss few categories of basic array manipulation here :  


-  Attributes of arrays    
-  Indexing of arrays         
-  Slicing of arrays    
-  Reshaping of arrays     
-  Joining and splitting of arrays    



```{python}
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0) #for reproducibility

x1 = np.random.randint(10, size= (3,4,5))
x1
```

#### Attributes of arrays

Each array has `ndim` , `shape` , `size`, `dtype`, `itemsize`, `nbytes` attributes.

```{python}
print(x1.ndim)
print(x1.shape)
print(x1.size)
print(x1.dtype)
print(x1.itemsize)
print(x1.nbytes)
```


#### Indexing of arrays

python is zero indexed unlike R where indexing starts from 1.

```{python}
x1 = np.array([1,2,3,5,8])
x1[0]
x1[4]
x1[-1]
x1[-2]

```


#### Slicing of arrays  

Just as we can use square brackets to access individual array elements, we can also use them to access subarrays with the slice notation, marked by the colon (:) character.  

```
x[start:stop:step]
```


```{python}
x
x = np.arange(10)
x[5:] # elements after index 5
x[4:7] # middle sub-array
x[::2]  # every other element
x[::-1]  # all elements, reversed
x[5::-2]  # reversed every other from index 5
```

lets take another example using multi-dimensional sub-arrays.  


```{python}
x2 = np.random.randint(10,size= (3,4))
x2
```


```{python}
x2[:2, :3]  # two rows, three columns
```

```{python}
x2[:3, ::2]  # all rows, every other column
x2[::-1, ::-1]
```

```{python}
x2

```
 one common needed routine is accessing single rows or columns of an array. This can be done by combining indexing and slicing, using an empty slice marked by a single colon `(:)`

```{python}
print(x2[:,0])
print(x2[0,:])
```



> 👉 In numpy array slices return views rather than copies  of array data. While in list slices will be copies.


let's take an example.  

```{python}
print(x2)
```

The above is our 2-dimensional array.  

```{python}
x2_sub = x2[:2,:2]
print(x2_sub)
```

Now if we modify this subarray, we will see that original array is changed.!

```{python}
x2_sub[0,0]=99
print(x2_sub)
```


Observe below :  
 
```{python}
print(x2)
```

> 👉 The above property is useful while working with large datasets.  




Despite nice features of array views its sometimes  useful to instead explicitly copy the data with in an array or a subarray. This can be mostly easily  done with `copy()` method.  

```{python}
x2_sub_copy = x2[:2, :2].copy()
print(x2_sub_copy)
```


if we now modify this subarray, the original array is not touched.  
```{python}
x2_sub_copy[0,0] = 42
print(x2_sub_copy)
```


```{python}
print(x2)
```



##### Reshaping of arrays  

lets take an example  

```{python}
grid  = np.arange(1,10).reshape((3,3))
grid
```

```{python}
x = np.array([1,2,3])
x.reshape((1,3))
```

```{python}
x[np.newaxis, :]
```




```{python}
x.reshape
```



```{python}
x[:, np.newaxis]
```






#### Array concatenation and splitting   

Concatenation, or joining of two arrays in NumPy, is primarily accomplished using the routines `np.concatenate`, `np.vstack`, and `np.hstack`, `np.concatenate` takes a tuple or list of arrays as its first argument, as we can see here:

```{python}
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([3, 2, 1])
np.concatenate([x, y])
```
It can also be used for two-dimensional arrays:

```{python}
grid = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6]])
                 
```


 concatenate along the first axis

```{python}
np.concatenate([grid, grid])
```

 concatenate along the second axis (zero-indexed)

```{python}
np.concatenate([grid, grid], axis=1)
```

For working with arrays of mixed dimensions, it can be clearer to use the np.vstack (vertical stack) and np.hstack (horizontal stack) functions:



```{python}

```
