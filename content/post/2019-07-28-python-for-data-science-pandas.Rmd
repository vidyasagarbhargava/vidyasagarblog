Pandas is a package which is built on top of Numpy and provides efficient implementation of `DataFrame`. These dataframes are multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels and often with heterogenous types.In this post we will focus on `Series`, `DataFrame` and related structure effectively.  



#### Installing and Using Pandas

Once pandas is installed you can import and check the version.  


```{python}
import pandas as pd
pd.__version__
```


#### Pandas Objects  

There are three fundamental pandas objects or structures : the `Series`, `DataFrame` and `Index`.  


#### The Pandas Series Object  

A Pandas `Series` is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. It can be created from a `list` or `array` as follows :  



```{python}
data = pd.Series([0.23,1,3,5.89,67])
data
```

As `Series` wraps both sequence of values and sequence of indices,which we can access with the `values` and `index` attributes. 


** Value**

```{python}
data.values
```


```{python}
data.index
```

Accessing data by associated index.

```{python}
data[2]
```


> ðŸ‘‰  Pandas Series is much more flexible and general as compare to one-dimensional numpy array.  



Numpy Array has an implicitly defined integer index used to access the values, the Pandas Series has an explicitly defined index associated with the values.

This explicit index definition gives the Series object additional capabilities. For example, the index need not be an integer, but can consist of values of any desired type.



```{python}
data = pd.Series([0,2,4,6,8], index = ['a','b','c','d','e'])
data
```
