Pandas is a package which is built on top of Numpy and provides efficient implementation of `DataFrame`. These dataframes are multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels and often with heterogenous types.In this post we will focus on `Series`, `DataFrame` and related structure effectively.  



#### Installing and Using Pandas

Once pandas is installed you can import and check the version.  


```{python}
import pandas as pd
pd.__version__
```


#### Pandas Objects  

There are three fundamental pandas objects or structures : the `Series`, `DataFrame` and `Index`.  


#### The Pandas Series Object  

A Pandas `Series` is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. It can be created from a `list` or `array` as follows :  



```{python}
data = pd.Series([0.23,1,3,5.89,67])
data
```

As `Series` wraps both sequence of values and sequence of indices,which we can access with the `values` and `index` attributes. 


** Value**

```{python}
data.values
```


```{python}
data.index
```

Accessing data by associated index.

```{python}
data[2]
```


> ðŸ‘‰  Pandas Series is much more flexible and general as compare to one-dimensional numpy array.  



Numpy Array has an implicitly defined integer index used to access the values, the Pandas Series has an explicitly defined index associated with the values.

This explicit index definition gives the Series object additional capabilities. For example, the index need not be an integer, but can consist of values of any desired type.



```{python}
data = pd.Series([0,2,4,6,8], index = ['a','b','c','d','e'])
data
```



#### Series as specialized dictionary


Constructing a `series` object directly from a Python dictionary.  

```{python}
mob_dict = {'Nokia': 37834,
'Samsung':234893,
'Apple':93849,
'Oneplus':298343}
mobile = pd.Series(mob_dict)
mobile
```

> By default, a Series will be created where the index is drawn from the sorted keys.  


Accessing items in dictionary style

```{python}
mobile['Oneplus']  
```


Series also supports array style operations such as slicing

```{python}
mobile['Nokia':'Samsung']
```



#### Constructing Series objects

```
pd.Series(data, index = index)
```

where `index` is optional argument and data can be one of many entities.  

For ex:-  Data can be list or numpy array in which case index defaults to an integer sequence.



```{python}
pd.Series([2,4,5,9])
```


data can be `scalar`

```{python}
pd.Series(5, index = [100,200,300])
```


data can be dicitonary in which index defaults to the sorted dictionary keys  

```{python}
pd.Series({2:'a', 1:'b', 3:'c'})
```



#### DataFrame Object  

If series is an analog of a one dimension array with flexible indices, a dataframe is analog of a two dimensional array with both flexible row indices and flexible column names.  


```{python}
mob_dict = {'Nokia': 35,
'Samsung':65,
'Apple':16,
'Oneplus':10}
models = pd.Series(mob_dict)
models
```

We can use dictionary to construct a single two dimensional object containing this information.  

```{python}
mobiles = pd.DataFrame({'Sales' : mobile, 'models': models})
mobiles
```

> Like the Series object, the DataFrame has an index attribute that gives access to the index labels

```{python}
mobiles.index
```



```{python}
mobiles.columns
```


```{python}
mobiles['models']
```


A pandas dataframe can be constructed in many ways.Here are few examples 

- From single Series object  


```{python}
pd.DataFrame(mobile, columns=['mobile'])
```



- From list of dicts

Any list of dictionaries can be made into dataframe.

```{python}
data = [{'a': i, 'b': 2 * i}
        for i in range(3)]
data
pd.DataFrame(data)
```



- From dictionary of series objects

```{python}
pd.DataFrame({'Sales':mobile, 'models': models})
```

- From two dimensional numpy array

```{python}
import numpy as np
pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(3, 2),
             columns=['foo', 'bar'],
             index=['a', 'b', 'c'])
```

- From numpy structured array  

```{python}
A = np.zeros(3,dtype=[('A', 'i8'), ('B', 'f8')])
A
```


```{python}
pd.DataFrame(A)
```
